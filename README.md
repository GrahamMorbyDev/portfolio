# My Portfolio

Welcome to my python portfolio, here you 
find all of the github links to my python projects and code
examples. This very site is built using python and Flask with SQLAlchemy running a small
back-end

### Running the site
To run this site locally follow these steps

- Clone the project from github
- Create a virtual environment
  - Mac: `python3 -m venv env`
  - Windows: `python -m venv env`
- Activate your environment
  - Mac: `source ./env/bin/activate`
  - Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`
- Install the required packages using `pip install`
- Then in your terminal run `python app.py`

This has been a labour of love for me to learn python, I have wanted to learn it for many years, and now I feel like I have a real grasp on the syntax, Flask, SQLAlchemy and other
wonderful things you can do!
